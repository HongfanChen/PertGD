Title: Escaping the saddle points by perturbation
Type: Package
Description: We implement four gradient-based methods which can escape from saddle point quickly.
     They are "Perturbed Gradient Descent", "Perturbed Accelerated Gradient Descent",
     "Faster Perturbed Gradient Descent", and "Faster Perturbed Accelerated Gradient Descent". 
     These methods are ensured to converge to second order stationary points in some steps related
     with problem's dimension and the accuracy we want, with probability 1.
